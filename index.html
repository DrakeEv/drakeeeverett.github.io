<h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
<p>This is a simple HTML page.</p>
<p>Today is 8.27.2025 When I'm writing this and I'm hoping to get a hang of version control with Github.</p>
<p>Now it's 9.7.2025 and I'm testing adding another one. Confused right now because I'm trying to just update this project but am still getting used to git controls.</p>
<p>It's 10/23/2025. Going to make another quick push and probably make some big jumps to the site from here. Wanna implement some of my favorite learning tools like a pomodoro timer.</p>
<p>It's 10/27, I thought I added a bunch of jumps but it's back to being this. Doesn't matter bc I didn't do much just copy/paste something from Chat GPT. Maybe I'll find something on Github to copy this time.</p>
